Using Markov Chain to represent relationships between words in song lyrics and then generating new lyrics.. _ahem_ interpretive poetry... from the graph

To run: `python3 compose.py`

You'll have to slightly change some of the code in order to adjust length of composition/which file is the vocabulary for the composition.
